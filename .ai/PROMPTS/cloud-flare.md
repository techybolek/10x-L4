You are an expert at GitHub Actions and Cloudflare. 

1) Familiarize yourself with the project:

- Current project configuration @astro.config.mjs 
- Dependencies and scripts @package.json 
- Current environment variables @env.d.ts

2) Make the necessary adjustments to the projects to support Cloudflare deployment

3) Create a scenario CI/CD "cloudflare.yml" where we deploy to an existing project in Cloudflare Pages. You can use the existing @pull-request.yml but dont run tests.
