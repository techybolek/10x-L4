Okay, I can help with that. Here is the detailed test plan based on the project's codebase and technical stack.

# Test Plan: {app-name}

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Brief Overview of the Project

{project-description} This test plan outlines the strategy and procedures for testing the application to ensure its quality, reliability, and adherence to requirements.

### 1.2. Scope of Testing

This test plan covers the functional and non-functional testing of the `{app-name}` web application, including:

*   Frontend UI and interactivity (Astro pages, React components).
*   Backend API endpoints (functionality, security, validation).
*   Database interactions (Supabase).
*   AI model integration (Openrouter.ai).
*   Authentication and Authorization flows.
*   Middleware logic.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Load/Stress testing beyond basic checks (unless specifically requested).
*   Usability testing (formal user studies).
*   Testing of third-party services themselves (Supabase platform, Openrouter.ai platform uptime).
*   Infrastructure testing (DigitalOcean infrastructure resilience).

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1. Types of Testing to be Performed

*   **Unit Testing:** Verify individual functions, helpers (`/src/lib`), non-UI components, and potentially extracted API handler logic using Vitest. Focus on logic correctness and edge cases.
*   **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different modules, such as API endpoints interacting with the Supabase database, API calls to the Openrouter.ai service, and middleware integration.
*   **API Testing:** Validate the functionality, request/response formats, status codes, error handling, authentication, and authorization of all API endpoints in `/src/pages/api` using automated tools (e.g., `supertest` within integration tests) or manual tools (e.g., Postman).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate real user scenarios from the browser using frameworks like Playwright or Cypress. Cover critical user flows like registration, login, generation creation, and viewing history.
*   **UI Testing:** Test React components (`/src/components/**/*.tsx`) for rendering, state changes, and interactions using Testing Library within Vitest. Verify Astro components (`/src/components/**/*.astro`, `/src/pages/**/*.astro`, `/src/layouts/**/*.astro`) render correctly.
*   **Security Testing:** Focus on authentication/authorization mechanisms, API input validation, checking for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., ensuring Astro's CSRF protection is active), and dependency scanning.
*   **Compatibility Testing:** Manual or automated checks on the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Manual Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted testing performed by QA to uncover issues not found by automated tests.

### 2.2. Test Environment Requirements

*   **Development:** Local machine setup with Node.js, pnpm, Docker (for local Supabase instance or connection to a dev Supabase project), and necessary API keys (Openrouter). Unit and integration tests are run here.
*   **Staging:** A dedicated environment hosted (e.g., on DigitalOcean via Docker) mirroring the production setup. Connected to a separate Supabase test project and using test API keys for Openrouter. E2E tests, API tests, and manual QA are performed here.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline configured to run linters, type checks, unit tests, and integration tests automatically on pushes and pull requests.

### 2.3. Test Data Requirements

*   Seed data for the staging Supabase project (e.g., test user accounts, sample generations, sample prompts).
*   Valid and invalid API keys for Openrouter testing.
*   Diverse input data for testing forms and API endpoints (valid, invalid, edge cases, different lengths, special characters).
*   User accounts with different states or roles (if applicable).

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1. High-Level Test Scenarios

*   **SC01: User Authentication:** Verify user registration, login, logout, session persistence, and access control.
*   **SC02: Generation Creation:** Verify users can successfully submit prompts, trigger AI generation, and see the results.
*   **SC03: Generation History:** Verify users can view their past generations accurately.
*   **SC04: API Validation:** Verify all API endpoints correctly validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.
*   **SC05: UI Responsiveness:** Verify the application UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes.
*   **SC06: Error Handling:** Verify user-friendly error messages are displayed for common issues (e.g., network errors, API errors, validation errors).

### 3.2. Detailed Test Cases for Critical Functionalities

*(Examples - A full test suite would contain many more detailed cases)*

*   **TC01.1 (Auth - Login Success):**
    *   **Given** a registered user exists.
    *   **When** the user navigates to the login page.
    *   **And** enters valid credentials.
    *   **And** submits the form.
    *   **Then** the user should be redirected to the main application page (e.g., `/generate`).
    *   **And** a valid session/cookie should be set.
    *   **And** user-specific UI elements (e.g., user email, logout button) should be visible.
*   **TC01.2 (Auth - Login Failure - Invalid Password):**
    *   **Given** a registered user exists.
    *   **When** the user navigates to the login page.
    *   **And** enters a valid email but an invalid password.
    *   **And** submits the form.
    *   **Then** the user should remain on the login page.
    *   **And** an appropriate error message ("Invalid login credentials") should be displayed.
*   **TC02.1 (Generation - Success):**
    *   **Given** a logged-in user is on the generation page (`/generate`).
    *   **When** the user enters a valid prompt into the form.
    *   **And** submits the form.
    *   **Then** a loading indicator should appear.
    *   **And** the `/api/generations` POST endpoint should be called successfully.
    *   **And** upon completion, the generated content should be displayed on the page.
    *   **And** the new generation should appear in the user's history (`/history`).
*   **TC04.1 (API - Create Generation - Unauthorized):**
    *   **Given** no user is logged in (no valid session cookie).
    *   **When** a POST request is sent to `/api/generations` with a valid payload.
    *   **Then** the API should return a `401 Unauthorized` status code.
    *   **And** the response body should indicate an authentication error.
*   **TC04.2 (API - Create Generation - Invalid Input):**
    *   **Given** a user is logged in.
    *   **When** a POST request is sent to `/api/generations` with an invalid payload (e.g., missing required fields).
    *   **Then** the API should return a `400 Bad Request` status code.
    *   **And** the response body should detail the validation errors.

## 4. Test Execution

### 4.1. Test Execution Process

1.  **Unit & Integration Tests:** Run automatically via CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) on every commit/PR. Developers run these locally before pushing code.
2.  **API Tests:** Can be run as part of the integration test suite in CI/CD or manually against the staging environment.
3.  **E2E Tests:** Run automatically via CI/CD pipeline against the staging environment after successful builds and deployments.
4.  **Manual Testing:** Performed by QA on the staging environment based on test cases and exploratory testing approaches before a production release candidate is approved.
5.  **Compatibility Testing:** Performed manually on the staging environment across target browsers.

### 4.2. Test Cycle Management

*   Test cycles will align with development sprints or release schedules.
*   A test cycle typically involves: Test planning -> Test case development/update -> Test environment setup -> Test execution (automated & manual) -> Defect reporting -> Regression testing -> Test reporting.
*   Tools like GitHub Issues or a dedicated test management tool will be used to track test execution progress and results.

## 5. Defect Management

### 5.1. Defect Reporting Process

*   Defects found during any testing phase will be reported using GitHub Issues.
*   Each defect report will include:
    *   Descriptive Title
    *   Steps to Reproduce (clear and concise)
    *   Expected Result
    *   Actual Result
    *   Environment (e.g., Staging, Browser version)
    *   Severity (e.g., Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial)
    *   Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
    *   Screenshots or Logs (if applicable)
    *   Labels (e.g., `bug`, `ui`, `api`, `auth`)

### 5.2. Defect Tracking and Resolution

*   Defects will be assigned to the appropriate developer for fixing.
*   The status of defects (e.g., Open, In Progress, Ready for QA, Closed) will be tracked in GitHub Issues.
*   Once fixed, the defect will be marked as "Ready for QA".
*   QA will verify the fix on the staging environment.
*   If the fix is confirmed, the defect will be closed. If not, it will be reopened with comments.
*   Regression testing will be performed to ensure the fix did not introduce new issues.

## 6. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan (this document).
*   Test Cases (stored in a test management tool or repository, potentially alongside code for automated tests).
*   Defect Reports (GitHub Issues).
*   Test Execution Reports (summarizing results from automated runs and manual testing cycles).
*   Release Readiness Report (summary of testing activities, outstanding defects, and recommendation for release).
