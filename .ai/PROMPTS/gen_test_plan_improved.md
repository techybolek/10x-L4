You are an experienced QA engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software project. You have been provided with the project's codebase and technical stack. Your goal is to generate a detailed, tailored test plan that takes into account the specific context of the project, its technical components, and priority elements.

Here is the project's codebase:
<codebase>
@codebase
</codebase>

The project uses the following technical stack:
<tech_stack>
@tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

Before creating the test plan, please analyze the provided information and consider the best approach. Wrap this work in <test_plan_preparation> tags inside your thinking block:

1. Analyze the codebase structure and identify key components. List these components.
2. Review the technical stack and consider its implications for testing. Note any specific testing requirements or challenges posed by each technology.
3. Identify potential risk areas or critical functionalities that require prioritized testing. List these areas.
4. Determine the types of testing that would be most appropriate for this project based on the identified components and risks.
5. Consider the necessary test environment setup based on the tech stack.
6. Prioritize testing efforts based on the identified components, risks, and critical functionalities.

Now, outside of the thinking block, please create a detailed test plan based on your analysis. The test plan should include the following sections:

1. Introduction
   - Brief overview of the project
   - Scope of testing

2. Test Strategy
   - Types of testing to be performed
   - Test environment requirements
   - Test data requirements

3. Test Cases
   - High-level test scenarios
   - Detailed test cases for critical functionalities

4. Test Execution
   - Test execution process
   - Test cycle management

5. Defect Management
   - Defect reporting process
   - Defect tracking and resolution

6. Test Deliverables
   - List of test artifacts to be produced

7. Risks and Mitigations
   - Potential risks in the testing process
   - Mitigation strategies

Please ensure that your test plan is tailored to the specific project context, takes into account the technical stack, and prioritizes testing based on critical components and potential risk areas identified in the codebase.

Your final output should consist only of the detailed test plan and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the test plan preparation section.
