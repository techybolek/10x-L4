Carefully examine the flashcard generation view and implement the following functionality. When the user selects an existing generation from the dashboard, they should be presented with a very similar view flashcard proposal view. The flashcards should be presented in the same way as the flashcard proposals, with the key differences being no Accept or Reject buttons. The view should include a way to navigate back to the dashboard. The view should also include a Save button to save the modified flashcards as well as Cancel.
